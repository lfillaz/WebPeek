This tool is a simple tool for exploring websites on the web. It is developed using the Python programming language. The tool provides an easy-to-use interface where the user is asked to enter the URL of the website he wishes to explore. After that, the user can choose one of two actions:

1. Extract Image URLs: This procedure searches for all images found in the specified web page and displays the URLs of each image found.

2. List of all pages: This action displays a list of all links available on the web page, allowing the user to index all internal pages connected to the site.

The tool relies on well-known Python libraries such as Requests to fetch the content of web pages and Beautiful Soup to analyze and extract information from those pages. The tool also uses output effects to make the user interface more attractive.

This tool is useful for developers and security analysts to scan and troubleshoot websites quickly and efficiently.
